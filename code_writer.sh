# -------------------------
# üìñ Usage Guide (English)
# -------------------------
# This script reads a source file and writes its content into a destination file
# in random chunks of lines, appending instead of overwriting.
#
# Example:
#   ./sample.sh source.sol destination.sol 2 4 1.5 3.5
#
# This means:
# - Read from "source.sol"
# - Append content into "destination.sol"
# - Each step will write between 2‚Äì4 random lines
# - Wait between 1.5‚Äì3.5 seconds before writing the next chunk
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The destination file will keep growing since it appends.
